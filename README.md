The  ipynb notebook program written is named PyCitySchools_Analysis.ipynb and resides under
pandas-challenge/PyCitySchools.  This program was based on the PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb program.

- Files used for the PyCitySchool district analysis are stored as followed:
  - pandas-challenge/PyCitySchools/Resources (input)
    schools_complete.csv
    students_complete.csv
 -  Output is generated to the Jupyter Notebook screen interactively
 -  The summary of my analysis is stored in a PDF Document named ##"Summary of District Student Test Data Analysis.pdf"##
    under pandas-challenge/PyCitySchools
  - README.md



The following website was used to obtain syntax for calling pandas.  In additon, just making sure I had the syntax correct for all commands:
  (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.sort_values.html)
