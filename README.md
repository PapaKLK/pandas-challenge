## Comments:   03-30-2023 CORRECTION MADE.  
##              The average used for passing math and reading was inadvertantly calculated as > 70.  I changed it to >= 70 instead.
##              The value then was used thru out the code correctly.

### Comments: 
The  ipynb notebook program written is named PyCitySchools_Analysis.ipynb and resides under
